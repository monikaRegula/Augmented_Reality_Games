>Recognize and Augment Images
Augmented Images in ARCore lets you build AR apps that can respond to 2D images, such as posters or product packaging, in the user's environment. You provide a set of reference images, and ARCore tracking tells you where those images are physically located in an AR session, once they are detected in the camera view.
